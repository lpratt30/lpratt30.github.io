title: File Server Implementation
gh-repo: lpratt30/lpratt30.github.io

In this project, I implemented a multi-threaded client-server system in C, which I later upgraded to a proxy cache server. 

Unfortunately, I cannot share this code publicly as that could result in plagiarism for an ongoing course. 

However, I have detailed descriptions of the code's functionality and design choices attached below:
