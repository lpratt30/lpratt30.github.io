Risk, a board game of strategy and negotiations, can be learned quickly by humans but remains a formidable challenge for AI. What makes Risk simple from a human perspective yet insurmountable for AI? Reinforcement Learning (RL) models have bested champions in more cognitively difficult games like Go, where objective rationality rules move selection; however, the behavior of the players does not play a role.

Our work redefines the problem space by treating Risk as an extension of research in sequential social dilemmas rather than zero-sum games. We argue that the failure to reach human-level performance in previous research stems from this misclassification and introduce mixed cooperation as a key element in solving Risk. It follows that there are more parallels with Risk and real-world scenarios involving human decision-making than zero-sum games. One such aspect of this is, unlike 1 v 1 strategy games, Risk gives players an opportunity to build relationships, show loyalty, deceive, betray, and take vengeance.
