In this project, I used reinforcement learning to do automated stock trading for profit. 

The reinforcement learning agent was successful and outperformed the manual trading strategy as well as buy-and-hold.

My report on the project and it's results are attached here: [Download the PDF](../assets/pdf/strategyEval.pdf)
