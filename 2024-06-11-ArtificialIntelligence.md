Knowledge Based Artificial Intelligence (KBAI) is a subset of AI that focuses on
using knowledge about a problem to reach a solution using a range of decision making strategies, many of the strategies similar to those of humans. Knowledge
in KBAI is as we the programmer define it; it can be any useful facet of a problem
that can be collected from the problem. 

Ravenâ€™s Progressive Matrices (RPM) are a form of testing for generalized human
intelligence where knowledge learned from previous problems across a test is
accumulated to determine answers to more difficult questions (Leavitt V.M, Raven Progressive Matrices). As it tests for generalized human intelligence and requires the use of knowledge for solving problems, it makes an excellent test of
KBAI. 

In this paper, techniques of knowledge based artificial intelligence are applied to resolve RPM questions across simplified subsets of the test alongside 48 of the original questions.
Primarily by using generate-and-test with means-ends-analysis,
the Agent was able to achieve 75/96 correct answers across the
mock B/C/D/E sets and 23/48 of the provided real RPM questions.
