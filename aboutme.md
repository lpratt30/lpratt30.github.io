title: About me
subtitle: Why I spend my limited mortal time programming 
---

My name is Luke Pratt. I love to think a lot about how things in the world work.  

I was forged in the fires of mechanical engineering. I took many more credits than needed to graduate, taking courses in philosophy, biomedical engineering, and even physics up to quantum mechanics.  

As I was working as a Process Engineeer in the Semiconductor industry, I learned that my favorite aspect's of the job were those regarding data analysis. 

I studied part-time at a community college to learn basic Java programming and data structures. I then went on to get my Master's in Computer Science, where I learned not only do I have an interest in data, I also find classic CS topics such as System's to be very interesting. 

I gave Samsung a 10-week notice and focused on the Master's degree. Despite a non-CS background, I took some of the more challenging possible courses. My complete course list was:

- Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning, Operating Systems, High Performance Computing, High Performance Computing Architecture, Big Data for Healthcare Analytics, Knowledge Based Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning for Trading

What else do you need?

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
