subtitle: Why I spend my limited mortal time Engineering 
---

My name is Luke Pratt. I was forged in the fires of Mechanical Engineering as an undergrad. 

While working at Intel, I found my passion for data analysis. On a daily basis, I would perform analysis to diagnose problems in a blackbox system containing thousands of variables of varying covariance. 

I pursued part-time studies at a community college to learn Java programming and data structures. Seeking a better schedule for studying, I transitioned to Samsung. However, the compressed (night) schedule at Samsung negatively impacted my well-being and study effectiveness. After giving a 10-week notice, I focused on completing my Masterâ€™s degree.

Despite not having a CS background, I took on some of the most challenging courses available. 

While I started the MS with a focus on Data Science, I quickly found classical CS topics like Systems to be fascinating and find the intuition to be useful for understanding how to process data in a distributed manner efficiently.

I graduated in May 2024. I am interested in roles that involve data analysis, machine learning, software development, and research. My passion lies in tackling interesting problems that enhance my skills for the future.
