title: About me
subtitle: Why I spend my limited mortal time Engineering 
---

My name is Luke Pratt. I was forged in the fires of mechanical engineering, having taken 30 more credits than needed to graduate, exploring courses in philosophy, biomedical engineering, and even quantum mechanics.

One of my notable projects involved creating a device to emulate firefly emission spectra, aiding biologists at the University of Georgia in studying genetic variations across populations.

While working as a Process Engineer in the semiconductor industry, I discovered my passion for data analysis. At Intel, I pursued part-time studies at a community college to learn Java programming and data structures. Seeking a better schedule for studying, I transitioned to Samsung, which also offered a substantial compensation increase. However, the compressed (night) schedule at Samsung negatively impacted my well-being and study effectiveness. After giving a 10-week notice, I focused on completing my Masterâ€™s degree.

Despite not having a CS background, I took on some of the more challenging courses available, including:

- Machine Learning
- Reinforcement Learning
- Deep Learning
- Operating Systems
- High Performance Computing
- High Performance Computer Architecture
- Big Data for Health Informatics
- Knowledge-Based Artificial Intelligence
- Machine Learning for Trading
  
While I started the MS with a focus on Data Science, I soon found classical CS topics like Systems to be fascinating.
                 
I am interested in roles that involve data analysis, machine learning, software development, and research. My passion lies in tackling interesting problems that enhance my skills for the future.
