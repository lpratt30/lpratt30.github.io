title: About me
subtitle: Why I spend my limited mortal time programming 
---

My name is Luke Pratt. I was forged in the fires of mechanical engineering. I took 30 more credits than needed to graduate, taking courses in philosophy, biomedical engineering, and even physics up to quantum mechanics. 

I even did a research project to make a device to emulate firefly emission spectra so that Biologists at the University of Georgia may be able to study genetic variations across populations! 

As I was working as a Process Engineeer in the Semiconductor industry, I learned that my favorite aspects of the job were those regarding data analysis. 

I studied part-time at a community college to learn basic Java programming and data structures. I then went on to get my Master's in Computer Science, where I learned not only do I have an interest in data, I find classical CS topics such as System's to be very interesting. 

I gave Samsung a 10-week notice and from there focused on finishing my Master's degree. Despite a non-CS background, I took some of the more challenging possible courses. My complete course list was:

- Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning, Operating Systems, High Performance Computing, High Performance Computing Architecture, Big Data for Healthcare Analytics, Knowledge Based Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning for Trading

I am interested in roles that require data analysis and/or Machine Learning. I am also interested in roles for software development. Finally, I am interested in research oriented roles.
